## ‚ú® Key Features

This application is packed with features to provide a comprehensive and personalized study experience.

#### üß† Plan Generation & Customization
* **Personalized Study Plan:** Generates a unique study plan based on your self-assessed skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Pro), the duration you want to study for, and the topics you want to focus on.
* **üéØ Topic Selection:** Choose from a wide range of essential topics like Arrays, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more. Or leave it blank for a well-rounded, comprehensive curriculum.
* **üóìÔ∏è Flexible Duration:** Select a preset duration (e.g., 2 Weeks, 1 Month) or input a custom number of days for your study plan.
* **‚ûï Add Custom Problems:** Easily add your own problems to the schedule, complete with a name, difficulty, topic, and a link to the problem statement.

#### üìä Productivity & Tracking
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize your progress at a glance. The dashboard features stats on total problems, completed tasks, overall completion percentage, and a progress bar.
* **üîî Spaced Repetition:** When you complete a problem, the app automatically schedules it for review at increasing intervals to reinforce learning. The dashboard shows how many problems are due for review.
* **üìã Daily Task Manager:** View your problems organized by day. Each day is marked as 'Past', 'Today', or 'Future' with clear visual cues.
* **‚úÖ Progress Tracking:** Mark problems as complete with a single click. The UI updates instantly, striking through the problem name and updating your daily and overall progress.

#### üìù Enhanced Note-Taking
* **Rich Text Notes:** For every problem, you can add, view, and edit detailed notes with an editor designed for technical documentation.
* **üíª Built-in Code Blocks:** Directly embed code snippets into your notes with syntax highlighting. A toolbar allows you to insert code blocks for various languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++).
* **üöÄ Note Templates:** Speed up your note-taking with pre-defined templates for `Approach`, `Complexity Analysis`, and `Edge Cases`.
* **üîó External Links:** Each problem card includes a direct link to its LeetCode page or a custom URL for quick access.
